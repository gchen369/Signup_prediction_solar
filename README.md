 Identifying customer for solar energy company

Predicted whether a customer will sign up with a solar power company, Using data from Google Analytics Platform:
    -Aggregate level demographics data
    -Individual level clickstream data
    
Our client is a pretty established energy company in Asia, but have just opened their Texas office. Their plan is to use digital marketing channels to grow subscriptions, and to expand their scope of operations after an internal target subscription is reached. 

Because of this, false negatives will be less desired when compared to false positives, because it would take them longer to reach the subscription target. At the same time, digital marketing is relatively cheap, so slight over investments in the beginning can be acceptable.

Because of this, our final model is one with a high recall score.
